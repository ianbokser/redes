# Practical Assignment - Computer Networks

## Introduction

This repository contains a practical assignment completed as part of a university course in Computer Networks. In this project, we configured network topologies and settings using Cisco Packet Tracer to understand and apply essential networking concepts. The included configuration file allows for the replication of the network environment we created as part of the coursework.

## Assignment Description

The main goal of this project was to understand data flow between devices, configure routing protocols, and ensure connectivity and network performance within a simulated environment.

## How to Run the File in Cisco Packet Tracer

1. **Download Cisco Packet Tracer V8.2.2:** If you haven’t already, download and install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) from Cisco’s official website.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-URL>
   ```
3. **Open the File:** Launch Cisco Packet Tracer and open the `.pkt` file included in this repository to load the network topology and configurations.
4. **Run the Simulation:** Once the file is open, use Cisco Packet Tracer's simulation tools to test and observe the behavior of the configured network.
